    <h2>Detailed Cleaning Process</h2>
    <p>
      Cleaning medium-sized tanks requires careful planning and execution. Our process begins with a complete inspection to identify any algae, sediment, or sludge accumulation. Our trained professionals use specialized brushes and scrubbing tools to manually clean every corner of the tank, ensuring that no contaminants are left behind. Next, we deploy a high-pressure water jet to remove stubborn sludge and sediment. This method ensures deep cleaning and improves water flow within the tank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disinfection is the next critical step. We apply safe, approved chemicals that eliminate bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microorganisms. The chemical solution is left for the recommended period to ensure full sanitization. Afterward, the tank is thoroughly rinsed to remove any chemical residues. Our team conducts a water quality test to confirm that the water is safe for household use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipes, inlets, and outlets are inspected and cleaned if necessary, ensuring optimal water flow. Filters are either cleaned or replaced to maintain water purity. Our professionals also provide guidance on preventive maintenance, including the recommended cleaning frequency for medium-sized tanks. This step ensures that your water remains safe and prevents future contamination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this service is designed to provide a comprehensive cleaning solution for tanks of 1000–2000 litres. By combining professional cleaning, disinfection, and maintenance advice, we ensure a hygienic water supply for your home. Our experts handle all equipment and chemicals, maintaining safety and environmental responsibility throughout the process.
